# Introduction to Energy Usage

![renewables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat231-s21/Blog-The-Naturers/main/images/s2g4-environment.png)
With climate change being one of the most pressing issues of our generation, finding ways to combat this enormous problem is going to require a bunch of system level changes all happening at the same time in order to mitigate the negative effects. Currently one of the biggest transformations that is going to be required to reduce the total amount of carbon emissions, especially here within the United States, is finding a way to transition the country towards renewable energy and cutting back on fossil fuels.  
  
  
While the country has been slowly adopting more and more renewable energy types over the past couple of decades, this transition is happening very slowly and varies heavily from state to state. By performing a deeper analysis on a state by state level of the types of energy stations that are present, how much CO2 each state emits, and how much energy each state consumes and produces, we can use these insights to inform policy decisions and find areas that could be used to expand the production of different renewable energy types. 


## Our Questions

![renewables2](images/energy_cover.png)

By building off our mid semester project, we wanted to advance our work and look closer at the distribution of different energy production types and the amount of energy they produce in relation to CO2 production.Ultimately through our different visualizations we are hoping to be able to answer questions such as how can identifying locations and outputs of renewable energy decisions influence policy decisions? How can the insights we find lead to reducing Co2 emissions within different states? What sorts of renewable energies are already present within different states and how can that help lead to what sorts of renewable energies get adopted in the future? How has the adoption of renewable and nonrenewable energies changed overtime? Understanding how different energy types are used and produced in different states would provide useful information to policy makers and energy companies in helping them figure out the best way to use their time and resources.


## Data

To answer these questions, we collected data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  The EIA has data that spans from before 1960 all the way to 2021, but the data we most wanted to focus on was for power plants in the US, of which only data from 2018 was available. We were able to find data on power plant location and generation capacity for the major renewable and nonrenewable energy sources including wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, nuclear, coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Included was information on carbon dioxide emissions by state and per capita, as well as energy consumption by state.

## Leaflet Results

From the leaflet maps above, we can start to get an understanding of where exactly different types of energy stations are located within the United States. While the above plots are just three examples taken from the Shiny App we created, in the Shiny App itself one has the ability to choose the energy type they are interested in, or even choose multiple energy types at the same time. These maps are interactive and one can zoom into any particular state or location, and a user can also click on any individual symbol and get the name of the plant, the exact location, and how much energy that plant produces. Also shown in the shiny app is higher level state summary information. The user has the ability to pick any particular state they are interested in and can see how much energy is generated by the different energy types within the state, and also how many of the different plants are currently within the state.

In particular if we analyze just these three plots above, we can start to see how when looking at the first plot of wind stations within the US, that there is a high number concentrated in the Midwest region but not many exist within the South. When looking at the Coal plot, we can start to see how coal plants are heavily located within Rust Belt region, and that there are not many coal plants on the West Coast. Finally when looking at the Nuclear plot, we can see that overall there is much lower number of nuclear plots within the United States and the ones that are currently running are located primarily along the East Coast. While the Shiny App can offer us even further in depth analysis when combining the leaflet plots with the summary tables, these are just a few of the high level insights we can gain from the plots alone.

## Choropleth Results

In addition to looking at energy within the United States as a whole, we decided that looking at renewable and nonrenewable energy production in each state would provide valuable information on state’s adoption of renewable energy sources. Some states have much higher adoption rates of renewable energy. Looking at energy production in each state can provide information as to which states should focus on increasing adoption of renewable energy and reducing usage of fossil fuels. In the choropleth map above looking at natural gas power plants in the United States, we can see that Texas, California, and Florida produce a massive amount of energy by burning natural gas. While “cleaner” than coal or petroleum, natural gas power plants still emit greenhouse gases, from 50-60% of the emissions of a coal plant. While the emissions are lower on a per plant basis, natural gas usage in the US is much greater than coal or petroleum, meaning emissions are going to be larger.

The other example choropleth from our Shiny App is energy from wind. While other types of renewable energy such as hydroelectric and geothermal can be limited in the number of places plants can be built, wind turbines can be built across the US. While some states such as Florida and Mississippi have little wind, many of the others have enough wind to justify the building of wind turbines to harness some of this energy. Texas has jumped on this alternative energy source, with turbines producing about a third of the energy that natural gas produces. Texas has adopted wind power, but in the recent winter storm many of the wind turbines in Texas froze over and quit working. This was due to cutting costs and not weatherproofing the turbines..Some people have concerns over pollution that wind turbines cause, environmental pollution as well as noise and visual pollution. In addition, they can have adverse effects on wildlife such as birds and bats, killing them if they are hit by the blades. These cons of wind turbines can be fixed by advances in technology and correct placement of wind farms. On top of the concerns mentioned, wind is sporadic. Reduction in generating capacity on some days could be detrimental if wind was the sole source of energy. Storage of wind energy in large batteries or coupling wind energy with another renewable source such as nuclear or solar power could up the efficacy of widespread adoption of wind power in more states.
